The Ballon D'or nominations league stats analysis for year 2023/2024 was done to analyze the nominated players performance and possible figure out the candidate suitable for the award. The data was gotten from Kagggle.com. The data was then subjected to onward cleaning before the analysis was carried out. This dataset contains detailed league performance statistics for the nominees of the 2024 Ballon D'Or across major European football leagues. The stats cover the 2023-2024 season, showcasing metrics such as goals, assists, expected goals (xG), expected assists (xAG), progression metrics, and more.

OBSERVATIONS

The total number of nominees for the 2023/2024 Ballon D'or award sums up to 30 from different teams, leagues, and nations across the globe. All of these nominations were made from the players performance in the 2023/2024 football season.


The team with the highest nominated players is Real Madrid with a total of six players and the League with the most nominated teams is the English Premier League, having a total of Ten teams making it to this list. By these statistics, it only implies that, the English premier league produced more very excellent players than all other leagues but then, Real Madrid from the Spanish La Liga had more representatives as a team in the list of players to contest for the Ballon D’OR award.


Moreso, it can be observed from the chart, that we had players who stood top at most of the ranking’s base on different criteria e.g. player with the most goal performance, player with the highest playing time, the count of player by age and year of birth.


Furthermore, the player with the most goal performance as revealed by the chart is Harry Kane of the English premier league with 36 goals while as Against Cole Palmer who had 22 goals standing at the least on the chart. Also, the player with the most playing minutes is William Saliba of the English Premier league with a total of 3042minutes of playing time. The age of the players is also shown on the chart and the age range with more nominated players stands as 24-25years with a total of 7 players fallen under this age range category. Equally, the year with the most nominated players was shared among year 1997, year 1998 and year 2000 with 4 nominees each.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the observations, I recommend the following:

1. The 30-man list should be expanded to give room for other players from other leagues to come and compete and probably win the title as it only shows this list of players are most from the world top 5 most popular leagues.

2. The age range of the player nominations should also be expanded, to allow more younger and more older players to have a fair chance to compete, as the data only shows fewer representation from the younger players and more older players.

5. Some of the criteria used to nominate players for this award is too long and very ambiguous as it encourages corruption, nepotism, favoritism and consumes requires a longer time to arrive at a winner as the organizers and have to spend more resources and time carrying out their research. 

4. Over the years, there has been allegations that the award goes only to players from a particular league and teams. I’m of the opinion that, if those allegations have been tested to be true, the law should be adjusted and the awarded be rotated amongst leagues.

7. Finally, a particular team shouldn't have an average of more than 2 players on this list, this is to give room to other players from other teams and leagues a level playing ground to compete
8.
